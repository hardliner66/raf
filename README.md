# The Research Actor Framework (raf)
raf is an experimental actor framework for me to play
around with the concept and experiment with different implementations.

# DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!

## Basics
The first implementation was built according to the following blog post:
https://ryhl.io/blog/actors-with-tokio/

and generalized into a library.
